How to Develop Spring Boot Application on Google App Engine - Step by Step Guide
============================
##### Web Application = Spring Boot + Cloud SQL + JPA + Spring Security + Thymeleaf + Bootstrap + Google App Engine
This sample is part of the guide [**"How to Develop Spring Boot Application on Google App Engine - Step by Step Guide"**](https://startup-with-gae.blogspot.com/2019/08/how-to-develop-spring-boot-application_37.html)

It demonstrates step by step, how to deploy a Spring Boot application on Google App Engine.
Application uses Spring Boot as a core technology. It also includes following components to present working web application:
* Cloud SQL (MySQL)
* JPA
* Spring Security
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap

For each step there is related branch containing working solution:
* [1-spring-boot-initial](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/1-spring-boot-initial)
* [2-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/2-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql)
* [3-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/3-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA)
* [4-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+Layout](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/4-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+Layout)
* [5-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+spring-security](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/5-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+spring-security)
* [6-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+spring-security-update](https://github.com/maciej-arkit/Spring-Boot-with-Google-App-Engine/tree/6-spring-boot+cloud-sql-mysql+JPA+Thymeleaf+spring-security-update)

You can create whole project step by step according to the instructions from the [guide](https://startup-with-gae.blogspot.com/2019/08/how-to-develop-spring-boot-application_37.html),
or you can navigate between branches to follow code changes.
